LDS Documentaton Project - The Scriptures - https://scriptures.nephi.org/

Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity
of their hearts, call upon his holy name. Yea, thus we see that the gate of
heaven is open unto all, even to those who will believe on the name of Jesus
Christ, who is the Son of God. (Helaman 3:27-28)

This project's goal is to provide open database and text export formats of
scriptures in the public domain for use by developers. The canon of scripture
is that used by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, containing:

King James Version of the Holy Bible
- Old Testament
- New Testament

Translated Scriptures and Modern Revelation
- The Book of Mormon - Another Testament of Jesus Christ
- Doctrine and Covenants
- The Pearl of Great Price

Exports are available in English for:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite 3
- CSV
- JSON
- Microsoft Excel
- Open Document Spreadsheet
- HTML
- Text file

The schemas for the databases are intentionally both normalized and
non-normalized, which is why you'll see seemingly duplicate tables. This is so
that people who want to jump right in, can start running queries against the
scriptures table, while those looking for other indexing or more complex
queries can use the other ones.
